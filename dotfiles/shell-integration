# Shell Integration

## How To Enable Shell Integration

The easiest way to install shell integration is to select the iTerm2>Install Shell Integration menu item. It will download and run a shell script as described below. You should do this on every host you ssh to as well as your local machine. The following shells are supported: tcsh, zsh, bash, and fish 2.3 or later. Contributions for other shells are most welcome.

When you select the iTerm2>Install Shell Integration menu item, it types this for you:

```sh
curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/install_shell_integration_and_utilities.sh | bash
```

Don't care for piping curl to bash? Do it by hand. This is also what you must do if you use a shell that isn't your login shell. Select your shell to see the appropriate instructions:

- For zsh:
```sh
curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/zsh \
-o ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh
```

Next, you need to load the script at login time. Add this to the end of ~/.zshrc:

```sh
source ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh
```

- For bash:
```sh
curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/bash \
-o ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash
```
Next, you need to load the script at login time. You need to add the following command to ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile. If you already have .profile then add it there, otherwise add it to .bash_profile. Put it at the end because other scripts may overwrite the settings it needs, such as `PROMPT_COMMAND`.

```sh
source ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash
```

Don't want to or can't install a login script? See the workaround at the end of this document using triggers.

## Features
This integration enables numerous features:

### Feature 1: Marks
- Benefit/Description: These are saved locations in history. They make it easy to navigate to previous shell prompts or other locations of interest.

### Feature 2: Alert when current command finishes running.
- Benefit/Description: iTerm2 will present a modal alert when a long-running command finishes, if you ask it to.

### Feature 3: Easy access to recently and frequently used directories.
= Benefit/Description: iTerm2 remembers the directories you use, sorting them by "frecency" and giving you access to them in the toolbelt and in a popup window.

### Feature 4: Assign profiles to hostnames, usernames, or username+hostname combinations.
- Benefit/Description: Sessions will automatically switch profiles as you log in and out according to rules you define.

## How it works
Shell Integration works by configuring your shell on each host you log into to send special escape codes that convey the following information:
- Where the command prompt begins and ends.
- Where a command entered at the command prompt ends and its output begins.
- The return code of the last-run command.
- Your username.
- The current host name.
- The current directory.
